# <span style="color:yellow">SMS Classifier Project</span>

## <span style="color:green">Project Overview</span>
Welcome to our SMS Classifier Project! The main goal here is to distinguish between spam and non-spam (ham) messages using various machine learning techniques. Our dataset is pre-labeled, making it perfect for training and testing our models.

## <span style="color:green">Features</span>
- <span style="color:orange">Data Preprocessing</span>: We clean up the SMS messages, removing noise and irrelevant information to improve model accuracy.
- <span style="color:orange">Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</span>: Dive into the data with insightful visualizations to understand the distribution of spam vs. ham messages.
- <span style="color:orange">Feature Engineering</span>: Extract useful features like character count, word count, and sentence count from the SMS messages.
- <span style="color:orange">Model Building</span>: Train and evaluate various models including Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, and more.
- <span style="color:orange">Model Improvement</span>: Utilize techniques like hyperparameter tuning and ensemble methods to enhance model performance.
- <span style="color:orange">Saving the Model</span>: Save the trained model and vectorizer for future use, ensuring seamless integration into other projects.
